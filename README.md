python and sql exercise

A client has provided three months worth of sales data with the following columns:
week_sold, price, num_sold, store_id, product_code, department_name. (e.g. beverage, food, clothes).
There is one row in the spreadsheet for each product-week combination. (note that a product might not have any sales on a particular week)

The client says that: 
1) There are 21 unique products in the store 
2) The total beverage sales in this store is $5277.5 in these three months. 
Q1) Are these statements accurate? If not, what is the correct number? Write a SQL query AND a python script to check the above.

Q2) How would you go about getting the data in the format (store_id, product_code, average_monthly_revenue)
Write a SQL query AND a python script for the above. Attach the CSV output file in your response.
